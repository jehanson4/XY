Find out how some other view can locate an extant instance of XYView.

PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage().showView("viewId");

Find out how some other view can create a new instance of XYView.

Let any number of other views use any given XYView.

Create XYViewOptions view. 

Permit 1 options view to connect to 1 XYView. Have pulldown in XYView to show its options view.

Define behavior when user selects "show view" on XYOptionsView.
EMPIRICALLY, if there's already an instance open, it will not create another instance but
	rather 'show' the extant instance.
If there's no instance open, should create it; but what to connect it to? Subcases:
	1. user wants it to be connected to one of set of extant XYView instances
	2. user wants it to be connected to a view not yet created.
So how about an XYView chooser that comes up iff it needs to be connected? w/ one of 
	the options being 'new'. User will need info to permit correct choice. Maybe a 'name'
	for each XYView instance? And include the name in the view's label.
